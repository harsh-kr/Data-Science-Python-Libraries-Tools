# Data-Science-Python-Libraries-Tools
As Python has gained a lot of traction in the recent years in Data Science industry, here are some of its most useful libraries for data scientists and engineers.
### 1. Numpy
The most fundamental package, around which the scientific computation stack is built, is NumPy (stands for Numerical Python). It provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python. The library provides vectorization of mathematical operations on the NumPy array type, which ameliorates performance and accordingly speeds up the execution.<br><br>

### 2. Pandas
Pandas is a Python package designed to do work with “labeled” and “relational” data simple and intuitive. Pandas is a perfect tool for data wrangling. It designed for quick and easy data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization.  Here is just a small list of things that you can do with Pandas:<br>
-> Easily delete and add columns from DataFrame<br>-> Convert data structures to DataFrame objects<br>->Handle missing data, represents as NaNs<br>-> Powerful grouping by functionality<br>

### 3. Matplotlib
A SciPy Stack core package and a Python Library that is tailored for the generation of simple and powerful visualizations with ease is Matplotlib. It is a top-notch piece of software which is making Python (with some help of NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas) a cognizant competitor to such scientific tools as MatLab or Mathematica.<br>

### 4. Seaborn
Seaborn is mostly focused on the visualization of statistical models; such visualizations include heat maps, those that summarize the data but still depict the overall distributions. Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and highly dependent on that.<br>
